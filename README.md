### Investigation on "sector dominance" or "sector monopoly".
**Human** - What is "sector dominance" or "sector monopoly"?

**ChatGPT** - In the context of the stock market, sector monopoly or dominance is generally viewed as a negative thing, as it can lead to reduced competition, limited choices for consumers, and potential abuse of market power. This can also have a negative impact on the overall economy. Therefore, in most cases, it is desirable to have a healthy level of competition in each sector, which can lead to innovation, lower prices, and improved quality of goods and services.

**Human** - If Vanguard is a major owner in all the companies in a sector could this lead to anti-competitive behavior?

**ChatGPT** - It is possible that if Vanguard is the major owner in all the companies in a sector, it could lead to anti-competitive behavior. One concern is that if Vanguard has significant ownership stakes in all major players in a sector, it could potentially discourage competition between those companies, since Vanguard may have less incentive to push for greater competition and innovation if it has significant holdings in each company. Additionally, if Vanguard uses its significant ownership stakes to influence the decisions of these companies, it could lead to anti-competitive behavior by creating an unfair advantage for those companies over others. However, it is important to note that owning shares in multiple companies does not necessarily mean that an investor has control over those companies, as shareholder voting power is typically proportional to the number of shares owned. Additionally, there are regulations in place to prevent anti-competitive behavior, such as antitrust laws, which can help to mitigate the potential risks associated with sector monopolies.

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that retrieves the top 10 shareholders and for a given stock symbol using the BeautifulSoup and pandas. The script uses the requests library to make an HTTP request to the Yahoo Finance website or the CNN money website to extract the required information using string manipulation techniques.

This notebook can be useful for investors or anyonbe who are interested in analyzing the ownership structure of a particular company and identifying the largest shareholders are how sector monopoly is playing out. It can also be used as a starting point for more complex analysis of shareholder distribution and activity.
